Prerequisites
An introduction to JavaScript
Recommendations
If homework is taking you more than 4 hours to complete:

Go to TA hours
Get on zoom with a classmate
Reach out to the instructional team during class time to schedule a 1:1 meeting
Don't stress about the Hungry For More section
If home work is taking you less than 4 hours to complete

Work on the Hungry For More section - make the most of your time here and find challenges
Help someone who is stuck, teaching is a great way to learn something more in depth
Reach out to the instructional team for more challenges/ways to keep growing with your abilities
Getting Started
Create a javascript file inside your homework folder that you will make for today to record your answers (maybe name it answers.js)
Keep your answers organized! Included a commented header for each section in your answers file. Something like the following:

``````
////////////////////////////////
// Easy Going
////////////////////////////////

....
``````

TEST YOUR WORK! Make sure that your code works node name_of_your_file.js.
If you're stuck on something for "too long" or get overly frustrated, make a comment and move on. Return to it later. You may find some later problems easier or need a break from what you're working on and set some fresh eyes on something you've been stuck on.
After each section (even if you're not fully done with it), add and commit your work.
Please use the commit messages that you see at the end of each section (modify it if you need to ie checkers almost solved). We will see these messages on Github. It will help us to see your progress. If you go back and fix a section, commit again with an updated message.

When you are done with your homework, push it to your origin(this is your Github) and make an issue on our repo.
Final note: You are not alone! Everyone else in the class is working on this as well. Send Slack messages, make a Zoom channel, or meet with the TA to discuss sticking points.

Part II: JavaScript Reps
Easy Going
Write a for loop that will log the numbers 1 through 20.
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Easy Going answered"
Get Even
Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers in 0 through 200.

Hint: Think about the increment expression.

ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Get Even answered"
Fizz Buzz
This is a classic problem that you should get really comfortable solving. If you've solved it before, try to make it more elegant and short.

Write a javascript application that logs all numbers from 1 - 100.
If a number is divisible by 3 log "Fizz" instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by 5 log "Buzz" instead of the number.
If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Fizz Buzz answered"
Wild Wild Life
Use the following arrays to answer the questions below (name,species ,age, hometown): You should be modifying the elements by accessing them. It is up to you which methods to use.

const wolfy = ["Wolfy", "wolf", 16, "Yukon Territory"]
const sharky = ["Sharky", "shark", 20, "Left Coast"]
const plantee = ["Plantee", "plant",  5000 , "Mordor"]
const porgee = ["Porgee", "Porg", 186, "Ahch-To"]
const dart = ["D'Art" , "Demogorgan Dog", 2, "Upside Down"]
Plantee just had her birthday; change Plantee's array to reflect her being a year older.
Change Wolfy's hometown from "Yukon Territory" to "Gotham City".
Give D'Art a second hometown by adding "Hawkins"
Porgee decides that Wolfy can't be named "Wolfy" anymore. Remove "Wolfy" from the wolfyarray and replace it with "Gameboy".
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Wild Wild Life answered"
Yell at the Ninja Turtles
Create an array with the members of the ninja turtles (Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo)
Use a for of loop(not a typo - try it out! Try a for ofloop) to call toUpperCase()on each of them and print out the result.
As a developer, you'll be a lifelong learner and constantly encountering new things. We'll give you little stretches like this to get you used to looking at documentation and figuring some things out on your own. You've got this!

ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Yell at the Ninja Turtles answered"
Methods, Revisited
Here is a list of favMovies:

const favMovies = ['Jaws', 'The Fellowship of the Ring', 'Howl\'s Moving Castle', 'Django Unchained', 'Cloud Atlas', 'The Usual Suspects', 'Toy Story', 'Conan the Barbarian', 'Titanic', 'Harry Potter', 'Fried Green Tomatoes', 'Volver', 'Oculus', 'Seven', 'Black Panther', 'Harry Potter', 'Imitation of Life', 'Snatch', 'Fast and Furious'];
Console log: the index of Titanic
Do the following and console.log the final results (I have included some thought questions, you don't have to write out an answer for those marked as such):
Note: if you have to add to the array, feel free to add any movie you'd like

use the .sortmethod Thought question: what did this do to the array? Did it permanently alter it?
Use the method pop
push"Guardians of the Galaxy"
Reverse the array
Use the shiftmethod
unshift- what does it return?
splice"Django Unchained" and add "Avatar" (try finding the index of "Django Unchained", instead of counting it yourself) Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
slicethe last half of the array (challenge yourself and try to programatically determine the middle of the array rather than counting it and hard coding it) - Thought question: did this permanently alter our array?
store the value of your slicein a variable, console.log it - Thought question: what is going on here?
console.log your final results
After running the above tasks, console.log the index of "Fast and Furious" -We removed it from the array, what value do we get when we look for the index of something that is not in the array?
Thought question: that we declared the variable favMovieswith const, and yet, we were allowed to change the array. Weird? Should we have used let?

ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Methods Revisited answered"
Where is Waldo
With the following multi-dimensional array
const whereIsWaldo = [["Timmy", "Frank"], "Eggbert",
                    ["Lucinda", "Jacc", "Neff", "Snoop"],
                    ["Petunia", ["Baked Goods", "Waldo"]]];
Remove Eggbert (hint look at the slice/splice method(s))
Change "Neff" to "No One"
Access and console.log "Waldo"
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Where is Waldo answered"
Excited Kitten
Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.
For every even number in your loop, log "...human...why you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...", or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random.
Hint 1
Hint 2
Hint 3
Hint 4
Hint 5
Hint 6
Image of cat with funny quote about dot

ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Excited Kittens answered"
Find the Median
Find the median number in the following numsarray, then console.log that number.
hint if you check the length of the array / 2, you might get not get a whole number. In which case, look into Math.floor( // something )
const nums = [14,11,16,15,13,16,15,17,19,11,12,14,19,11,15,17,11,18,12,17,12,71,18,15,12];

Expected output:
=> 15

Return of the Closets
Below, we've given you examples of Kristyn and Thom's closets modeled as data in JavaScript. Use this data to answer the following questions.

const kristynsCloset = [
  "left shoe",
  "cowboy boots",
  "right sock",
  "Per Scholas hoodie",
  "green pants",
  "yellow knit hat",
  "marshmallow peeps"
];

// Thom's closet is more complicated. Check out this nested data structure!!
const thomsCloset = [
  [
    // These are Thom's shirts
    "grey button-up",
    "dark grey button-up",
    "light blue button-up",
    "blue button-up",
  ],[
    // These are Thom's pants
    "grey jeans",
    "jeans",
    "PJs"
  ],[
    // Thom's accessories
    "wool mittens",
    "wool scarf",
    "raybans"
  ]
];
Alien Attire
Kristyn's left shoe has traveled through time and space and turned up in Thom's accessories drawer! Remove Kristyn's shoe from the array and save it to the variable kristynsShoe. Use that variable to add Kristyn's lost shoe to Thom's accessories array.
Dress Us Up
Modify your code to put together 3 separate outfits for Kristyn and Thom. Put the output in a sentence to tell us what we'll be wearing. Mix and match!
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Kristyn and Thom have their outfits ready for class - array practice"
Dirty Laundry
Continue looking at the closet arrays:

Time to do laundry - loop through Kristyn's closet and log the sentence "WHIRR: Now washing (item)" for each item in the array.
Inventory
Thom wants to do inventory on his closet. Using bracket notation, log the arrays containing all of Thom's shirts, pants, and accessories.
ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
"Hungry for More: I tackled..."
Technical Requirements
A JavaScript file that runs without syntax errors (comment out stuff that doesn't work)
At least one commit message per problem
